# LEARNING ABOUT PHP 

### BASICS 
``` php
<?php 
```
This is how you start the whole thing. It is however recommended (by Fredric) to not have this at the end, despite being shown a lot. 

A printout to the web is done by "echo" (res.send in js typ). 

### SUPERGLOBALS 
"\$_PATCH" & "$_DELETE" aren't superglobals, yet AI thinks so sometimes.
